When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  
  You may work at different locations using different devices. A remote repository allows you to continue
  working on an additional device providing a means for the original device to update its local files when needed.
  
  There may be several people working on a project. The repository facilitates a group effort by having tools to 
  track changes and merge code when necessary.
  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	You may have edited code on local that isn't fully functional yet. Someone else has commited code to the repository
	with code that may overlap your own. If git automatically tried to update local, you'd be forced to prematurely
	deal with a merge.
