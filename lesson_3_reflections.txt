When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  
  You may work at different locations using different devices. A remote repository allows you to continue
  working on an additional device providing a means for the original device to update its local files when needed.
  
  There may be several people working on a project. The repository facilitates a group effort by having tools to 
  track changes and merge code when necessary.
  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	You may have edited code on local that isn't fully functional yet. Someone else has commited code to the repository
	with code that may overlap your own. If git automatically tried to update local, you'd be forced to prematurely
	deal with a merge.
  
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

	Clone: is a copy of a repository.
	
	Fork: a special type of clone that github makes for you on their own machines. It additionally identifies the 
	original owner of the repository forked. The fork is a master branch that you edit on your github account, so 
	your edits do not modify the master of the original repository. You can suggest the owner of the original do
	a pull to update from your modifications.
	
	Branch: allows multiple threads of development in a repository. The main code is preserved in the master branch.
	creating a new branch copies the master to a new branch that can be checked out and worked on independently from
	the main code. To get the independently developed code back into the main master branch requires that it be merged.
