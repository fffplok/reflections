What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	When you initialize a repository, navigate to the folder that you want to contain the repository.
	Then run git init. This creates the repository by adding the .git folder for the files git requires
	for tracking the state of the repository.

	You need to do this to be able to use git to manage version control for files in the folder.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	The working directory is the collection of files in the folder on your computer that git interacts with.
	Staging area is different from the working directory as it is a place for git to track what files are
	marked to be available for commits (versioning). Staging is local and not part of the repository that
	others may access. User may keep files in the working directory out of the staging area and ultimately
	the repository. The repository is a collection of versioned files and when pushed to the hub may be
	accessed by others.
